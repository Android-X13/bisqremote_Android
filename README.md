# Bisq Notification Android App

Since Bisq is a desktop-based application, this Android app enables you to pair it with your desktop
application and receive important notifications such as trade updates and offer alerts when you are
not near your computer.

## How to Run

To build this project, you will need to create your own `google-services.json` file and place it
under the Bisq/ directory. Refer to
[firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#add-config-file)
for more information.

## Architectural Design

For information on the architectural design, refer to the
[Bisq Remote Specification](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisqremote/wiki/Specification).
